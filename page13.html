    <h1>The Inner Sanctum</h1>
    <p>You open the door and see a cloaked figure sitting on a pile of gold.
        The chamber reeks of old books, strange herb and, pizza rolls ?<br>
        "You think you can just walk in here without knocking?" "Ugh, I should have put a seal on that console." the figure groans.<br>
        The figure reveals herself, a tall woman with short black hair and covered in scales where you can see.<br>
        "Whatever, I am the Archsage Crystella. What do you want?"</p>
