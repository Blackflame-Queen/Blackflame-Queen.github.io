    <h1>The Grimoire</h1>
    <p>You open what you think is an enchanted tome, but it's actually just the diary of whoever lives here.<br>
        As you snoop through this person's diary, they open the door and drop their belongings.<br> 
        Not only have you violated this old woman's privacy, you also invaded her home.<br>
        It wasn't abandoned, she just struggles with home repair!</p>
