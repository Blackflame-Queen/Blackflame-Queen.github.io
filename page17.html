        "I love her, but I feel like we're on different wavelengths..."<br>
        "If I just keep studying, I could become a dragon like her, and then we could be together!"<br>
        You suggest that she should just speak in dragon-tongue to Griselda, seems pretty obvious.<br>
        "Oh...maybe you're right... I probably have a tome on dragonic somewhere around here..."<br>
        Sometimes we get so caught up in one notion, that we donâ€™t consider the obvious, even when it's right in front of our faces.<br>
        She looks almost disappointed for a moment, but finds a dragonic tome in the clutter and turns away to begin studying.<br>
        "Thanks, and here, you can have this pile of gold, I'll contain it in this enchanted bag of holding."<br>
        "Oh and this." She hands you an amulet with a red gem embedded in it. Then she opens a portal for you to leave.<br>
        You return home with a bulging sack of treasure in tow and don the amulet. She didn't remark on it, but you begin to feel...different...<br>
        What happens next? Who knows!
